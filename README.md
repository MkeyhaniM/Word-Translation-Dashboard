# Translation Manager

Hey there! 👋 This is my Translation Manager project - a tool I built to make managing multilingual content a breeze. It's perfect for developers who need to handle translations in their apps without the headache.

## What's in the Box? 🎁

- **Speak Many Languages**: Handles English, Spanish, French, and German out of the box
- **Instant Changes**: No more waiting around - see your updates right away
- **Looks Good**: Dark mode, clean design, and it works great on any device
- **Easy to Use**: Just drag and drop to organize your translations
- **Keeps Track**: Never lose your changes with automatic version tracking

## What I Used to Build It 🛠️

I built this using some of my favorite tools:

- Next.js 14 (it's awesome!)
- TypeScript (for that sweet type safety)
- Tailwind CSS (makes styling a dream)
- React Context (keeps everything in sync)
- @hello-pangea/dnd (for smooth drag and drop)

## Let's Get Started! 🚀

First things first, you'll need:

- Node.js (version 18 or newer)
- npm or yarn (whichever you prefer)

Then just follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone it down
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translation-manager.git
cd translation-manager

# Install the good stuff
npm install

# Fire it up!
npm run dev
```

Pop open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you're good to go!

## How It's Organized 📁

Here's how I've set things up:

```
translation-manager/
├── app/
│   ├── components/     # All the reusable bits
│   ├── context/       # Where the magic happens
│   ├── dashboard/     # The main control center
│   ├── public/       # The public-facing side
│   ├── globals.css   # The styling foundation
│   └── page.tsx      # The welcome mat
├── public/           # Static stuff
└── package.json      # The recipe book
```

## Using It Is a Breeze 🌬️
